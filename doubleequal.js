// const a=100;
// const b='100'
// console.log(a==b);


const a='stri';
const b=100;
console.log(a==b);
// we get true as outputt because the type of the variable a is converted to a strin before making the comparison. 
// After the comparison   the value is checked in both the variables. if its the same we will get true nd we will get false if the values are different.
